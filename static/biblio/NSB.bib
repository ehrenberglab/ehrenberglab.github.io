	Abstract = {Severe climatic and environmental changes are far more prevalent in Earth history than major extinction events, and the relationship between environmental change and extinction severity has important implications for the outcome of the ongoing anthropogenic extinction event. The response of mineralized marine plankton to environmental change offers an interesting contrast to the overall record of marine biota, which is dominated by benthic invertebrates. Here, we summarize changes in the species diversity of planktic foraminifera and calcareous nannoplankton over the Mesozoic?Cenozoic and that of radiolarians and diatoms over the Cenozoic. We find that, aside from the Triassic?Jurassic and Cretaceous?Paleogene mass extinction events, extinction in the plankton is decoupled from that in the benthos. Extinction in the plankton appears to be driven primarily by major climatic shifts affecting water column stratification, temperature, and, perhaps, chemistry. Changes that strongly affect the benthos, such as acidification and anoxia, have little effect on the plankton or are associated with radiation. ?Fossilizing marine plankton provide some of the most highly temporally and taxonomically resolved records of biodiversity since the Mesozoic. ?The record of extinction and origination in the plankton differs from the overall marine biodiversity record in revealing ways. ?Changes to water column stratification and global circulation are the main drivers of plankton diversity. ?Anoxia, acidification, and eutrophication (which strongly influence total marine fossil diversity) are less important in the plankton.

	Abstract = {The sulfur isotopic composition of seawater sulfate oscillates over geological time, responding to changes in the redox state and biogeochemical processes on the Earth's surface. During times of rapid perturbations in sulfur isotopes where biostratigraphic controls do not provide good temporal resolution, sulfur isotopes of seawater sulfate can be a useful tool for stratigraphic correlations. Secular data of seawater sulfur isotopes archived in evaporite, carbonate associated sulfate, and marine barite from worldwide locations allow reconstruction of a continuous seawater sulfate S-isotope curve for the Phanerozoic and Protozoic. For some time-intervals (e.g., the Cenozoic), excursions in high resolution records are identified and these short-term fluctuations can be applied for stratigraphy and correlation. High resolution S-isotope records can also substantially enhance our understanding of temporal variations in the global sulfur cycle and earth system evolution.},

	Abstract = {The sulfur isotope ratio (δ34S) recorded in marine barite is commonly used to estimate secular changes in the sulfur isotopic composition of seawater sulfate (δ34SSO4) throughout Earth's history. The Cenozoic record demonstrates a drastic 5‰increase in seawater δ34SSO4 during the Early Eocene. However, the gradient of this excursion is based on only a few data points. Taking advantage of a much improved biostratigraphic framework, we redefine the Eocene δ34SSO4 data with a new high-resolution barite based δ34S record between 60 and 30 Ma. Our results show that the rise of δ34SSO4 starts about 3 million years later (\~{}53 Ma) and lasts about 9 million years longer (until 38 Ma) than previously depicted. As such, the gradient of the δ34S curve is \~{}0.4‰/Myr. The radiogenic strontium isotopic ratio in barite suggests that some of the samples used for the original barite record are affected by diagenetic alteration.},

@article{doi:10.1098/rstb.2019.0392,
	Abstract = { A tenet of conservation palaeobiology is that knowledge of past extinction patterns can help us to better predict future extinctions. Although the future is unobservable, we can test the strength of this proposition by asking how well models conditioned on past observations would have predicted subsequent extinction events at different points in the geological past. To answer this question, we analyse the well-sampled fossil record of Cenozoic planktonic microfossil taxa (Foramanifera, Radiolaria, diatoms and calcareous nanoplankton). We examine how extinction probability varies over time as a function of species age, time of observation, current geographical range, change in geographical range, climate state and change in climate state. Our models have a 70--80\% probability of correctly forecasting the rank order of extinction risk for a random out-of-sample species pair, implying that determinants of extinction risk have varied only modestly through time. We find that models which include either historical covariates or account for variation in covariate effects over time yield equivalent forecasts, but a model including both is overfit and yields biased forecasts. An important caveat is that human impacts may substantially disrupt range-risk dynamics so that the future will be less predictable than it has been in the past. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `The past is a foreign country: how much can the fossil record actually inform conservation?' },

	Abstract = {
            A fundamental question in ecology is how the success of a taxon changes through time and what drives this change. This question is commonly approached using trajectories averaged over a group of taxa. Using results from probability theory, we show analytically and using examples that averaged trajectories will be more symmetric as the number of averaged trajectories increases, even if none of the original trajectories they were derived from is symmetric. This effect is not only based on averaging, but also on the introduction of noise and the incorporation of a priori known origination and extinction times. This implies that averaged trajectories are not suitable for deriving information about the processes driving the success of taxa. In particular, symmetric waxing and waning, which is commonly observed and interpreted to be linked to a number of different paleobiological processes, does not allow drawing any conclusions about the nature of the underlying process.

The projected ages of radiolarian first and last occurrences derived from the line of correlation of the age/depth plots have been computed from these sites, and 28 radiolarian events have thereby been newly cross calibrated to North Pacific diatom and other stratigraphy. Several of the North Pacific radiolarian events are older than in previously published equatorial Pacific calibrations, and some may be diachronous within the North Pacific. These patterns may be due to complex latitudinal patterns of clinal variation in morphotypes within lineages, or to migration events from the North Pacific towards the Equator.},

	Abstract = {The iterative evolutionary radiation of planktic foraminifers is a well-documented macroevolutionary process. Here we document the accompanying size changes in entire planktic foraminiferal assemblages for the past 70 My and their relationship to paleoenvironmental changes. After the size decrease at the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/P) boundary, high latitude assemblages remained consistently small. Size evolution in low latitudes can be divided into three major phases: the first is characterized by dwarfs (65--42 Ma), the second shows moderate size fluctuations (42--14 Ma), and in the third phase, planktic foraminifers have grown to the unprecedented sizes observed today. Our analyses of size variability with paleoproxy records indicate that periods of size increase coincided with phases of global cooling (Eocene and Neogene). These periods were characterized by enhanced latitudinal and vertical temperature gradients in the oceans and high diversity (polytaxy). In the Paleocene and during the Oligocene, the observed (minor) size changes of the largely low-diversity (oligotaxic) assemblages seem to correlate with productivity changes. However, polytaxy per se was not responsible for larger test sizes.},

	Abstract = {{Planktonic and benthic foraminifera are the most significant providers of information on the state of surface and deep oceans in the past. Many foraminiferal proxies rely on the knowledge of ecological preferences of individual species and the assumption that these remained similar through time. Consequently, the applicability of such proxies is limited in time by the extent of the modern fauna. By analysing extensive datasets of species occurrences, we show that the modern oceanic foraminifer fauna originated during the Neogene. This occurred during two distinct diversification pulses: one in the Middle Miocene (17--14 Ma) and the second at the Miocene/Pliocene transition (7--4 Ma). The first diversification coincides with the time of a major change in the frequency of the dominant climate cycles during the Miocene Climatic Optimum. The environmental driver of the second diversification could be related to an increased provincialism induced by the closure of the Panama Seaway, but the exact link is not clear, particularly for the plankton. Surprisingly, major changes of ocean circulation due to the growth of Antarctic ice-sheet and closure of low-latitude seaways appear to have caused mainly extinctions. Given the age of the latest diversification and extinction pulses that shaped the modern foraminiferal fauna, we conclude that calibrated proxies based on assemblage properties should not be interpreted quantitatively in sediments older than the late Pliocene.}},

	Abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the planktonic foraminifera as tracers of past oceanic environments. Paleoceanography has always been closely connected with the study of planktonic foraminifera. The prolific production and excellent preservation of foraminiferal fossils in oceanic sediments has produced probably the best fossil record on Earth, providing unparalleled archives of morphological change, faunal variations, and habitat characteristics. Planktonic foraminifera are the most common source of paleoceanographic proxies, be it through the properties of their fossil assemblages or as a substrate for extraction of geochemical signals. The steady rain of foraminiferal shells is responsible for the deposition of a large portion of deep-sea biogenic carbonate. Stable isotopic signals extracted from planktonic foraminifera soon became a standard tool for the recognition of glacial cycles and eventually facilitated the recognition of orbital pacing of the ice-ages. The chemical composition of foraminiferal calcite proved to be a fertile ground for the development of proxies. The chapter highlights the most common and most promising foraminiferal proxies and puts them in the context of modern biological knowledge.},

We determined the macroevolutionary trajectory in the median size of dinoflagellate cysts to compare with the macroevolutionary size change in other plankton groups. We found the median size of the dinoflagellate cysts generally decreases through the Cenozoic. Diatoms exhibit an extremely similar pattern in their median size over time, even though species diversity of the two groups has opposing trends, indicating that the macroevolutionary size change is an active response to selection pressure rather than a passive response to changes in diversity. The changes in the median size of dinoflagellate cysts are highly correlated with both deep ocean temperatures and the thermal gradient between the surface and deep waters, indicating the magnitude and frequency of nutrient availability may have acted as a selective factor in the macroevolution of cell size in the plankton. Our results suggest that climate, because it affects stratification in the ocean, is a universal abiotic driver that has been responsible for macroevolutionary changes in the size structure of marine planktonic communities over the past 65 million years of Earth's history.},

	Abstract = {The Middle Eocene diatom and silicoflagellate record of ODP Site 1260A (Demerara Rise) is studied quantitatively in order to throw light on the changes that siliceous phytoplankton communities experienced during a Middle Eocene warming event that occurred between 44.0 and 42.0&#xa0;Ma. Both Pianka's overlap index, calculated per couple of successive samples, and cluster analysis, point to a number of significant turnover events highlighted by changes in the structure of floristic communities. The pre-warming flora, dominated by cosmopolitan species of the diatom genus Triceratium, is replaced during the warming interval by a new and more diverse assemblage, dominated by Paralia sulcata (an indicator of high productivity) and two endemic tropical species of the genus Hemiaulus. The critical warming interval is characterized by a steady increase in biogenic silica and a comparable increase in excess Ba, both reflecting an increase in productivity. In general, it appears that high productivity not only increased the flux of biogenic silica, but also sustained a higher diversity in the siliceous phytoplankton communities. The microflora preserved above the critical interval is once again of low diversity and dominated by various species of the diatom genus Hemiaulus. All assemblages in the studied material are characterized by the total absence of continental and benthic diatoms and the relative abundance of neritic forms, suggesting a transitional depositional environment between the neritic and the oceanic realms.},

	Abstract = {{A group of ~100 species of elongate, cylindrical deep-sea benthic foraminifera (families Stilostomellidae, Pleurosto-mellidae, Nodosariidae) with complex, often constricted apertural structures, became extinct during increasingly cold glacial periods in the late Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (MPT, ~2.6--0.6 Ma). We document the evolutionary history and architecture of this Extinction Group (Ext. Gp) through the Cenozoic at four lower bathyal-upper abyssal Indian Ocean sites (ODP 722, 744/738, 758, 763), seeking clues to the cause of this morphologically-targeted extinction episode late in the Cenozoic.Eighty percent of the 116 Ext Gp. species present in the Cenozoic of the Indian Ocean originated globally in the Eocene or earlier, compared with 23--37\\% of other Quaternary deep-sea foraminifera. The Ext. Gp had its peak species richness and relative and absolute abundances in the late Eocene. The rapid warming of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, that resulted in a loss of 30--50\\% of deep-sea foraminiferal species, had no impact on the Ext. Gp in the one Indian Ocean section (ODP 744/738) studied. Major Cenozoic changes in the Ext. Gp, including increased species turnover, changes in dominant species, a decline in abundance, loss in diversity, and finally extinction, mostly occurred during the middle Eocene to early Oligocene, middle to late Miocene, and late Pliocene to middle Pleistocene. These were times of stepped increase in the volume of polar ice, global oceanic cooling, surface-water eutrophication, seasonality of phytoplankton production, deep-water ventilation, and southern deep-water carbonate corrosiveness. The final decline and disappearance of the Ext. Gp began in the late Miocene at high latitudes (744/738), but not until the late Pliocene (758, 763) or MPT (722) at lower latitudes.We hypothesize that the loss of the Ext. Gp of deep-sea foraminifera may have been caused by the decline or demise of their specific food source (detrital phytoplankton or bottom-dwelling microbes) that was abundant in the Greenhouse World and was decimated by the stepwise cooling, ventilation, or eutrophication of the oceans that began in the middle and late Eocene.}},

	Abstract = {{Biostratigraphy has been an integral part of hydrocarbon exploration for much of the last century. The basic concepts and methods of using fossils to characterize coeval strata remain unchanged from the pioneer studies of the late 18th century. This paper describes major developments in biostratigraphic techniques that have occurred during the last twenty years.Advances in deep-water drilling and exploitation technology have promoted a shift from deltaic and shelf reservoirs to slope and basin-floor-fan reservoir targets. This has resulted in a greater emphasis on open marine, planktonic fossils, such as nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera, and lesser emphasis on terrestrial and shallow-water fossils such as benthic foraminifera, pollen, and spores. The development of deviated and horizontal production wells has stimulated the need to monitor the path of wells in real time at the wellsite. The resulting ``biosteering'' is the quantitative bed-by-bed study of a vertical pilot well, and the subsequent monitoring of the fossil content of the horizontal well, which enables the drill path to stay in the target strata.The Ocean Drilling Program and its predecessor the Deep Sea Drilling Project led to the construction of more refined geologic time scales that integrate biostratigraphy with magnetostratigraphy, isotope stratigraphy, and astronomical cycles. These time scales allow the allocation of numeric ages to increasing amounts of biostratigraphic datums, which aids in the automation of correlation using computers. The concepts and methods of sequence stratigraphy refined in the last twenty years placed biostratigraphy at the heart of geological models, closely integrating it with well-log and seismic stratigraphy. The concepts of sequence stratigraphy stimulated further biostratigraphic research and changed the way biostratigraphic data are used in correlations.Computational power has made it possible to rapidly record, manipulate, and display biostratigraphic data. This has led to the development of programs that automate the process of correlation, paleobathymetric interpretation, construction of expert systems for the identification of fossils, and compilation of databases of text and digital images. These advances have led to more information being extracted from the raw biostratigraphic data.Application of Modern Stratigraphic Techniques: Theory and Case HistoriesSEPM Special Publication No. 94, Copyright {\copyright} 2010SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology), ISBN 978-1-56576-199-5, p. 57--80.}},

	Abstract = {The amount and quality of paleontological data is rapidly increasing thanks to the new developments in geological dating, 3D visualization and morphometrics, chemical and histological analysis, and database storage. However, despite the fact that data from fossils, their assemblages, temporal successions, spatial gradients and environments are of an evolutionary-ecological nature, their contribution to current mainstream evolutionary-ecological theory and methodology is low. The use of fossils is not seldom restricted to calibration (e.g., in phylogenetics), or source for historical speculation after having analyzed modern data first (e.g., in macroecology). Yet, the scale of resolution of many paleontological time series (103--105 years) is highly apt for studying the dynamics of species, the average lifetime of which is in the order of 106--107 years. In order to fully profit from the wealth of data from the rock archive, a large-scale ``stratophenomics''approach is needed. The resulting data archives will not only further contribute to an increase in the knowledge of past species, communities and environments, but will also generate more and innovative theory on the mechanisms underlying species and higher taxon dynamics. Examples of new and promising approaches towards generating paleontological data will be presented under the headings of the three major stratophenomics dimensions: time, morphology and environment. Highlighted fields include astrochronology, sclerochronology and 3D morphometrics.},

	Abstract = {Long-term evolution is thought to take opportunities that arise as a consequence of mass extinction (as argued, for example, by Gould, 2002) and the following biotic recovery, but there is absolutely no evidence for this being the case. However, our study shows that eutrophication by oceanic mixing also played a part in the enhancement of several evolutionary events amongst marine organisms, and these results could indicate that the rates of oceanic biodiversification may be slowed if upwelling becomes weakened by future global warming. This paper defines three distinct evolutionary events of resting spores of the marine diatom genus Chaetoceros, to reconstruct past upwelling through the analysis of several DSDP, ODP and land-based successions from the North, South and equatorial Pacific as well as the Atlantic Ocean during the past 40million years. The Atlantic Chaetoceros Explosion (ACE) event occurred across the E/O boundary in the North Atlantic, and is characterized by resting spore diversification that occurred as a consequence of the onset of upwelling following changes in thermohaline circulation through global cooling in the early Oligocene. Pacific Chaetoceros Explosion events-1 and -2 (PACE-1 and PACE-2) are characterized by relatively higher occurrences of iron input following the Himalayan uplift and aridification at 8.5Ma and ca. 2.5Ma in the North Pacific region. These events not only enhanced the diversification and increased abundance of primary producers, including that of Chaetoceros, other diatoms and seaweeds, but also stimulated the evolution of zooplankton and larger predators, such as copepods and marine mammals, which ate these phytoplankton and plants. Current thinking suggests new evolutionary niches open up after a mass extinction, but our study finds that eutrophication can also stimulate evolutionary diversification. Moreover, in the opposite fashion, our results show that as thermohaline circulation abates, global warming progresses and the ocean surface becomes warmer, many marine organisms will be affected by the environmental degradation.},

	Abstract = {Size is one of the most important characteristics of any organism and can readily be used in quantitative analyses of patterns in physiology, ecology, and evolution. One of the best archives for the history of organism evolution are deep-sea sediments, because (1) microfossils are one of their major constituents, (2) they can be accurately dated, and (3) they are available from almost all areas of the world. We present new data on size variations of entire oval to circular coccolith assemblages during the last 65million years from a number of globally distributed deep-sea cores. We document the generally decreasing size patterns of these assemblages from the early Cenozoic to the Holocene and show that higher size variability and thus largest sizes can be observed in high latitudes. However, the documented size trends are not directly related to available proxies for paleoenvironmental conditions. Taxonomic investigations of the measured assemblages indicate that the evolution, abundance, and extinction of large-sized species in different lineages, such as Calcidiscus, Coccolithus, Chiasmolithus, Cruciplacolithus, Helicosphaera, and Reticulofenestra, and the newly developed small-coccolith producing taxa in the Neogene, such as Emiliania, Gephyrocapsa, Reticulofenestra haqii, R. minutula and Umbilicosphaeraceae, are responsible for the observed assemblage size variations during the last 65million years.},

We analyzed a global compendium of fossil planktic foraminifera from the early Cretaceous to the present after correcting for temporal differences in sampling effort. Our results show that their morphological diversity has increased exponentially through time in two different phases. The first phase collapsed at the Cretaceous--Paleogene boundary transition. The second phase developed through the Cenozoic era and declined during the Pliocene--Pleistocene interval, a period of time that was dominated by enhanced climatic and oceanographic instability. In none of these phases diversity reached an equilibrium level. Cenozoic faunas evolved faster than those inhabiting Cretaceous oceans, perhaps as a result of a higher environmental variability. Our results indicate that planktic foraminifera conform to an exponential diversification model. However, because catastrophic events have repeatedly reset the level of biological diversity and have kept it below the maximum, we cannot confirm whether the level of diversity is potentially unlimited.},

	Abstract = {Molecular genetic investigations of the highly abundant extant planktonic foraminifera plexus Globigerinella siphonifera/Globigerinella calida have recently shown this group to be the genetically most diverse one within planktonic foraminifera, separating it into 12 distinct genetic types belonging to three main genetic lineages. Independently, several morphological or physiological variants have been described within the group, but the correlation between the high genetic diversity and the phenotypic variability remains unclear. In this study, we combine genetic data with morphometric analyses of shell shape and porosity of genotyped individuals of the different genetic lineages. Our morphometric measurements suggest a differentiation of three morphotypes within the plexus, two of which possess the elongated chambers described as a typical trait of G. calida. These two morphotypes with elongated chambers are associated with two distinct genetic lineages. The G. calida morphology therefore appears to have evolved twice in parallel. Unexpectedly, we show that the two morphotypes with elongated chambers can be separated from each other by characters seen in the lateral view of their shells. This implies that the taxonomy of the extant members of the genus Globigerinella should be revised. A comparison with the original descriptions and type specimens of members of the genus shows that two genetic types of one major lineage correspond to G. calida. The second group with elongated chambers is associated with a recently diverged genetic type and we propose to reinstate the name Globigerinella radians for this distinct form. The remaining nine of the 12 genetic types correspond to the G. siphonifera morphology, and in the absence of evidence for morphological differentiation, they form a paraphyletic morpho-taxon. Our results highlight the prevalence of parallelism in the evolution of shell morphology in planktonic foraminifera even at the lowest level of relatedness represented by genetic types.},

	Abstract = {Diatoms are one of the most abundant and diverse groups of phytoplankton and play a major role in marine ecosystems and the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. Here we combine DNA metabarcoding data from the Tara Oceans expedition with palaeoenvironmental data and phylogenetic models of diversification to analyse the diversity dynamics of marine diatoms. We reveal a primary effect of variation in carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) on early diatom diversification, followed by a major burst of diversification in the late Eocene epoch, after which diversification is chiefly affected by sea level, an influx of silica availability and competition with other planktonic groups. Our results demonstrate a remarkable heterogeneity of diversification dynamics across diatoms and suggest that a changing climate will favour some clades at the expense of others.},

	Abstract = {
Acquiring data on the occurrences of many types of difficult to identify objects are often still made by human observation, for example, in biodiversity and paleontologic research. Existing computer counting programs used to record such data have various limitations, including inflexibility and cost. We describe a new open-source program for this purpose---Raritas. Raritas is written in Python and can be run as a standalone app for recent versions of either MacOS or Windows, or from the command line as easily customized source code. The program explicitly supports a rare category count mode which makes it easier to collect quantitative data on rare categories, for example, rare species which are important in biodiversity surveys. Lastly, we describe the file format used by Raritas and propose it as a standard for storing geologic biodiversity data. `Stratigraphic occurrence data' file format combines extensive sample metadata and a flexible structure for recording occurrence data of species or other categories in a series of samples.

@article{Jungck2019,
	Abstract = {The illustrations of the late nineteenth-/twentieth-century scientist/artist Ernst Haeckel, as depicted in his book Art Forms in Nature (originally in German as Kunstformen der Natur, 1898--1904), have been at the intersection of art, biology, and mathematics for over a century. Haeckel's images of radiolaria (microscopic protozoans described as amoeba in glass houses) have influenced various artists for over a century (glass artists Leopold and Rudolph Blaschka; sculptor Henry Moore; architects Rene Binet, Zaha Hadid, Antoni Gaudi, Chris Bosse and Frank Gehry; and designers--filmmakers Charles and Ray Eames). We focus on this history and extend the artistic, biological, and mathematical contributions of this interdisciplinary legacy by going beyond the 3D visual, topological, and geometric analyses of radiolaria to include the nanoscale with graph theory, spatial statistics, and computational geometry. We analyze multiple visualizations of radiolaria generated through Haeckel's images, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, micro- and nanotomography, and three-dimensional computer rendering.Mathematical analyses are conducted using the image analysis package ``Ka-me: A Voronoi Image Analyzer.'' Further analyses utilize three-dimensional printing, laser etched crystalline glass art, and sculpture. Open sharing of three-dimensional nanotomography of radiolaria and other protozoa through MorphoSource enables new possibilities for artists, architects, paleontologists, structural morphologists, taxonomists, museum curators, and mathematical biologists. Distinctively, newer models of radiolaria fit into a larger context of productive interdisciplinary collaboration that continues Haeckel's legacy that lay a foundation for new work in biomimetic design and additive manufacturing where artistic and scientific models mutually and robustly generate wonder, beauty, utility, curiosity, insight, environmentalism, theory, and questions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Unbiased time series of diversity dynamics are vital for quantifying the grand history of life. Applications include identifying ancient mass extinctions and inferring both biotic and abiotic controls on diversification rates. We introduce divDyn, a new r package that facilitates the calculation of taxonomic richness, extinction and origination rates from time-binned fossil data. State-of-the-art counting protocols, and sampling standardization functions permit the reconstruction of biologically meaningful time series. Additional functions permit the partitioning of turnover rates by environmental affinity. Using divDyn, we display Phanerozoic-scale diversity dynamics of marine invertebrates. With the help of the core function and standard subsampling options, we revisit the hypothesis of declining taxonomic rates over time, mass extinctions and equilibrial diversity dynamics and assess their methodological dependency. Our results suggest that rates declined only over the early Phanerozoic, only three mass extinctions stand out clearly, and evidence of equilibrial dynamics is dependent on the used methods. The modular and fast implementation of published methods ensures traceability, reproducibility and comparability of future studies.},

@article{Lewitus162248,
	Abstract = {Understanding the relative influence of various abiotic and biotic variables on diversification dynamics is a major goal of macroevolutionary studies. Recently, phylogenetic approaches have been developed that make it possible to estimate the role of various environmental variables on diversification using time-calibrated species trees, paleoenvironmental data, and maximum-likelihood techniques. These approaches have been effectively employed to estimate how speciation and extinction rates vary with key abiotic variables, such as temperature and sea level, and we can anticipate that they will be increasingly used in the future. Here we compile a series of biotic and abiotic paleodatasets that can be used as explanatory variables in these models and use simulations to assess the statistical properties of the approach when applied to these paleodatasets. We demonstrate that environment-dependent models perform well in recovering environment-dependent speciation and extinction parameters, as well as in correctly identifying the simulated environmental model when speciation is environment-dependent. We explore how the strength of the environment-dependency, tree size, missing taxa, and characteristics of the paleoenvironmental curves influence the performance of the models. Finally, using these models, we infer environment-dependent diversification in three empirical phylogenies: temperature-dependence in Cetacea, δ13C-dependence in Ruminantia, and CO2-dependence in Portulacaceae. We illustrate how to evaluate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic variables in these three clades and interpret these results in light of macroevolutionary hypotheses for mammals and plants. Given the important role paleoenvironments are presumed to have played in species evolution, our statistical assessment of how environment-dependent models behave is crucial for their utility in macroevolutionary analysis.},

	Abstract = {Common species shape the world around us, and changes in their commonness signify large-scale shifts in ecosystem structure and function. However, our understanding of long-term ecosystem response to environmental forcing in the deep past is centred on species richness, neglecting the disproportional impact of common species. Here, we use common and widespread species of planktonic foraminifera in deep-sea sediments to track changes in observed global occupancy (proportion of sampled sites at which a species is present and observed) through the turbulent climatic history of the last 65 Myr. Our approach is sensitive to relative changes in global abundance of the species set and robust to factors that bias richness estimators. Using three independent methods for detecting causality, we show that the observed global occupancy of planktonic foraminifera has been dynamically coupled to past oceanographic changes captured in deep-ocean temperature reconstructions. The causal inference does not imply a direct mechanism, but is consistent with an indirect, time-delayed causal linkage. Given the strong quantitative evidence that a dynamical coupling exists, we hypothesize that mixotrophy (symbiont hosting) may be an ecological factor linking the global abundance of planktonic foraminifera to long-term climate changes via the relative extent of oligotrophic oceans.},

humanity's response to predictions of future global climate change,
e.g., extinction risk with global warming. Paleodiversity studies, however,
frequently use genera as a proxy for species diversity, a practice
that has often been questioned. Tests using actual data of the impact
of using species-level versus genus-level taxonomy in paleodiversity-paleoenvironmental
studies are also lacking. We conduct such a test,
based on a recent study that showed a strong correlation of Cenozoic
marine planktonic diatom species diversity to geochemical climate
proxies. Using an updated version of the data set, we still find a strong
correlation of Cenozoic diatom species diversity to environment. Using
identical data but instead genera results in the loss of all significant
correlations of diversity to environmental change. This occurs due to
the earlier rise and later stability in genus versus species diversity data,
a pattern known to be common between taxonomic ranks in the fossil
record, and in general models of diversification. We conclude that
studies of paleodiversity, particularly those addressing biotic responses
to future environmental change, need to demonstrate the adequacy
of genera as a proxy for species diversity, or use species-level data.},
