	abstract = {Biodiversity on Earth is shaped by abiotic perturbations and rapid diversifications. At the same time, there are arguments that biodiversity is bounded and regulated via biotic interactions. Evaluating the role and relative strength of diversity regulation is crucial for interpreting the ongoing biodiversity changes. We have analyzed Phanerozoic fossil record using public databases and new approaches for identifying the causal dependence of origination and extinction rates on environmental variables and standing diversity. While the effect of environmental factors on origination and extinction rates is variable and taxon specific, the diversity dependence of the rates is almost universal across the studied taxa. Origination rates are dependent on instantaneous diversity levels, while extinction rates reveal delayed diversity dependence. Although precise mechanisms of diversity dependence may be complex and difficult to recover, global regulation of diversity via negative diversity dependence of lineage diversification seems to be a common feature of the biosphere, with profound consequences for understanding current biodiversity crisis. Large-scale diversity dynamics in oceans is universally regulated by diversity-dependent origination and extinction rates.},

	abstract = {Abstract Microfossils have a ubiquitous and well-studied fossil record with temporally and spatially fluctuating diversity, but how this arises and how major events affect speciation and extinction is uncertain. We present one of the first applications of PyRate to a micropalaeontological global occurrence dataset, reconstructing diversification rates within a Bayesian framework from the Mesozoic to the Neogene in four microfossil groups: planktic foraminiferans, calcareous nannofossils, radiolarians and diatoms. Calcareous and siliceous groups demonstrate opposed but inconsistent responses in diversification. Radiolarian origination increases from c. 104 Ma, maintaining high rates into the Cenozoic. Calcareous microfossil diversification rates significantly declines across the Cretaceous--Palaeogene boundary, while rates in siliceous microfossil groups remain stable until the Paleocene--Eocene transition. Diversification rates in the Cenozoic are largely stable in calcareous groups, whereas the Palaeogene is a turbulent time for diatoms. Diversification fluctuations are driven by climate change and fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, leading to different responses in the groups generating calcareous or siliceous microfossils. Extinctions are apparently induced by changes in anoxia, acidification and stratification; speciation tends to be associated with upwelling, productivity and ocean circulation. These results invite further micropalaeontological quantitative analysis and study of the effects of major transitions in the fossil record. Despite extensive occurrence data, regional diversification events were not recovered; neither were some global events. These unexpected results show the need to consider multiple spatiotemporal levels of diversity and diversification analyses and imply that occurrence datasets of different clades may be more appropriate for testing some hypotheses than others.},

@article{huang_ostracods_2022,
	abstract = {Biodiversity databases are changing the longevity of data in the era of open science. They also represent a collaboration opportunity in analyzing large-scale (paleo)biological patterns beyond a local project or a time scale. Ostracods, microscopic crustaceans, are a component in many biodiversity databases. They live in most kinds of aquatic environments today and their fossil record spans nearly the whole of the Earth's metazoan biosphere history from Ordovician to Holocene. Thus, ostracods provide an ideal model system for understanding large-scale biodiversity patterns and dynamics in both space and time. Thanks to many contributors, current and future ostracodologists have access to databases that have gone through numerous improvements and have been populated by many datasets. However, rapid growth of databases has caused confusion among users regarding available data, technical terms and database aims. We review key databases that include ostracods, summarizing their history of development, current spatial and temporal coverage, various types of data models and the intertwined relationships between databases. We also present a quantitative summary of ostracod diversity history based on the Paleobiology Database. Our investigations show that the database field is transitioning from the traditional single focus to multipurpose, from static to dynamic data display/download and from independent systems to collaborative networks. We compare the ways several databases approach persistent challenges such as taxonomic harmonization, validation of the original sampling metadata and paleolocality uncertainties. With increasing capability of data integration, databases continue to require enormous efforts regarding high-quality data entry and careful coordination among scientists and technical teams.},

@article{waldeck_calibrating_2022,
	abstract = {The triple oxygen isotope composition of seawater sulfate, as recorded in marine sulfate evaporites and barites, is commonly used to interpret past changes in atmospheric pO2/pCO2 and gross primary production (GPP). In practice, the most-negative measured triple oxygen isotope value (Δ'17O) of sulfate from a marine evaporite deposit is thought to most closely represent contemporaneous seawater sulfate and is used to calculate atmospheric composition. However, a range of triple oxygen isotope compositions are typically measured within a single marine evaporite basin. Here, we characterize in detail the variability in the triple oxygen isotope composition of the sulfate in gypsum sampled from three Messinian (5-6 Ma) marine evaporite sub-basins from the Western Mediterranean Basin. Evaporite sulfate is offset from contemporaneous seawater sulfate and reflects mixing between two end-member sulfate populations: the original seawater sulfate and sulfate that has been isotopically reset after basin restriction. The combined Δ'17O and δ18O compositions of sulfate within a stratigraphic context offer the opportunity to better constrain the degree to which marine sulfate evaporites preserve the original isotopic composition of open ocean seawater sulfate. This study encompasses an exploration of mass-dependent fractionation, isotope equilibrium with water, and various scenarios of mixing. Our results calibrate the utility of marine sulfate evaporites in constraining the contemporaneous, open ocean triple oxygen isotope composition of seawater sulfate.},

@article{antell_thermal_2021,
	abstract = {Abiotic niche lability reduces extinction risk by allowing species to adapt to changing environmental conditions in situ. In contrast, species with static niches must keep pace with the velocity of climate change as they track suitable habitat. The rate and frequency of niche lability have been studied on human timescales (months to decades) and geological timescales (millions of years), but lability on intermediate timescales (millennia) remains largely uninvestigated. Here, we quantified abiotic niche lability at 8-ka resolution across the last 700 ka of glacial--interglacial climate fluctuations, using the exceptionally well-known fossil record of planktonic foraminifera coupled with Atmosphere--Ocean Global Climate Model reconstructions of paleoclimate. We tracked foraminiferal niches through time along the univariate axis of mean annual temperature, measured both at the sea surface and at species' depth habitats. Species' temperature preferences were uncoupled from the global temperature regime, undermining a hypothesis of local adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, intraspecific niches were equally similar through time, regardless of climate change magnitude on short timescales (8 ka) and across contrasts of glacial and interglacial extremes. Evolutionary trait models fitted to time series of occupied temperature values supported widespread niche stasis above randomly wandering or directional change. Ecotype explained little variation in species-level differences in niche lability after accounting for evolutionary relatedness. Together, these results suggest that warming and ocean acidification over the next hundreds to thousands of years could redistribute and reduce populations of foraminifera and other calcifying plankton, which are primary components of marine food webs and biogeochemical cycles.},

@article{benson_biodiversity_2021,
	abstract = {Summary The fossil record is the primary source of information on how biodiversity has varied in deep time, providing unique insight on the long-term dynamics of diversification and their drivers. However, interpretations of fossil record diversity patterns have been much debated, with a traditional focus on global diversity through time. Problems arise because the fossil record is spatially and temporally patchy, so `global' diversity estimates actually represent the summed diversity across a set of geographically and environmentally distinct regions that vary substantially in number and identity through time. Furthermore, a focus on global diversity lumps the signal of ecological drivers at local and regional scales with the signal of global-scale processes, including variation in the distribution of environments and in provincialism (the extent of subdivision into distinct biogeographic regions). These signals cannot be untangled by studying global diversity measures alone. These conceptual and empirical concerns necessitate a shift away from the study of `biodiversity through time' and towards the study of `biodiversity across time and space'. Spatially explicit investigations, including analyses of local- and regional-scale datasets, are central to achieving this and allow analysis of geographic scale, location and the environmental parameters directly experienced by organisms. So far, research in this area has revealed the stability of species richness variation among environments through time, and the potential climatic and Earth-system drivers of changing biodiversity. Ultimately, this research program promises to address key questions regarding the assembly of biodiversity, and the contributions of local-, regional- and global-scale processes to the diversification of life on Earth.},

@article{devries_miocene_2021,
	abstract = {Global sea-level changes and substantial vertical displacement along the Monte Grande Fault (MGF) in the lower R{\'\i}o Ica Valley of south-central Peru influenced the accumulation of bioclast-bearing and diatom-bearing Miocene siliciclastic sediments in an area of the East Pisco forearc basin (EPB) colloquially known as Laberinto. Two depositional hiatuses in the Laberinto area ({\textasciitilde}17--14 Ma, {\textasciitilde}12.5--10 Ma) manifest as sediment-filled erosional depressions a few kilometers in breadth. Erosion of the older depression was preceded by an {\textasciitilde}18-Ma massive debris flow, possibly triggered by motion on the MGF causing lower Miocene lithoclastic olistoliths of up to two hundred meters length to spill off the footwall block. Sediment shed from the same footwall block may have formed previously recognized early Miocene deltas. From 14 to 13 Ma, the older depression filled with sediments herein assigned to the provisionally named Laberinto, Pampa, and Naranja members of the Pisco Formation, the latter member being characterized by marine delta foreset beds. The three members are at least partly correlative with the Pisco-0 sequence of the Pisco Formation. The younger depression was overrun at 10 Ma by debris flows of lithoclastic and granitic cobbles and boulders, then filled with diatomaceous silty sand with 5-m-sized lithoclastic olistoliths. The two lithologies constitute the provisionally named Mature Formation. Radiometric and newly revised biochronological data from throughout the EPB coupled with new diatom data from the Laberinto area have provided new insights into the correlation of sequences within the Chilcatay and Pisco formations and the interaction of local and basin-wide tectonism and global eustatic sea-level events across the basin.},

@article{dutkiewicz_carbonate_2021,
	abstract = {Deep-sea carbonate deposition is a complex process that is encapsulated in the carbonate compensation depth (CCD)---a facies boundary separating calcareous sediments from non-carbonates. Knowing how the CCD has varied over time is important for understanding and predicting the distribution of seafloor sediments and assessing their role in the global carbon cycle. We focus on the South Atlantic Ocean where the most recent CCD curve is based on Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 73 sites drilled in 1980 in the South Atlantic Ocean. We compute the South and central South Atlantic CCD from the Late Cretaceous to the present day using updated age models from 45 DSDP and Ocean Drilling Program sites and backtracking with lithology-specific decompaction, eustasy, and dynamic topography. Our models extend further back in time and show more fluctuations than previous reconstructions, with the CCD varying by hundreds of meters during a span of 2--3 m.y. The addition of eustasy and dynamic topography deepens the CCD by as much as 500 m between 74 Ma and 45 Ma, and by {\textasciitilde}200 m during the Cenozoic. The central South Atlantic CCD diverges from the average South Atlantic CCD during the Eocene and Miocene, when it was {\textasciitilde}1 km shallower. These regional deviations may be due to changes in primary productivity and/or carbonate dissolution leading to reduced carbonate accumulation rates. Our CCD curves highlight the importance of regional processes in carbonate deposition across the South Atlantic and provide improved constraints for the modeling of geochemical cycles.},

@article{tuo_present_2021,
	abstract = {Since the 1960s  297 expeditions carried out by Scientific Ocean Drilling have recovered more than 4×105 meters of cores and collected a large amount of data. However, the data based on core sample testing and direct observation are scattered in different documents and databases in a heterogeneous format, which hinders the extensive sharing and effective use of them. Through systematic investigation of the official reports, databases, and academic papers of the four stages of Scientific Ocean Drilling, we show the present status of these scientific data including their sources, storage media, and specific types. The data of Scientific Ocean Drilling mainly consist of shipboard and post-expedition results. Nearly 200 data types classified into 15 categories including coring summary, lithostratigraphy, sedimentology and mineralogy, paleontology, stratigraphy, geochemistry, structural geology, geophysics, etc. are recorded in tables, figures, and texts. We find that these scientific data are hierarchically organized and have specific spatial-temporal properties； their sources are both straightforward and complex with different storage formats； and data types of different sites are not only consistent but also diverse. The data of Scientific Ocean Drilling are typical scientific big data in the field of earth sciences. Meanwhile, it is believed that the compilation of the Scientific Ocean Drilling Data would be of significance for fast data acquisition and future studies. This step not only has the potential to solve major scientific problems in the field of Earth science such as long-term biological evolution, global material circulation, paleoclimate and paleoceanography, and deep-sea mineral resource evaluation, but may contribute to the transformation of scientific research paradigm as well. Meanwhile, a proposal for data format unification and data compilation is also presented here.},

@article{westacott_revisiting_2021,
	abstract = {Diatoms are a major primary producer in the modern oceans and play a critical role in the marine silica cycle. Their rise to dominance is recognized as one of the largest shifts in Cenozoic marine ecosystems, but the timing of this transition is debated. Here, we use a diagenetic model to examine the effect of sedimentation rate and temperature on the burial efficiency of biogenic silica over the past 66 million years (i.e., the Cenozoic). We find that the changing preservation potential of siliceous microfossils during that time would have overprinted the primary signal of diatom and radiolarian abundance. We generate a taphonomic null hypothesis of the diatom fossil record by assuming a constant flux of diatoms to the sea floor and having diagenetic conditions driven by observed shifts in temperature and sedimentation rate. This null hypothesis produces a late Cenozoic (∼5 Ma to 20 Ma) increase in the relative abundance of fossilized diatoms that is comparable to current empirical records. This suggests that the observed increase in diatom abundance in the sedimentary record may be driven by changing preservation poten- tial. A late Cenozoic rise in diatoms has been causally tied to the rise of grasslands and baleen whales and to declining atmospheric CO2 levels. Here we suggest that the similarity among these records pri- marily arises from a common driver---the cooling climate system--- that drove enhanced diatom preservation as well as the rise of grass- lands and whales, rather than a causal link among them.},

	abstract = {Although previous phylogenetic analyses suggested that the araphid diatom family Plagiogrammaceae is monophyletic, there is still not a clear understanding of relationships among the genera, and the taxonomy of several genera --Dimeregramma and Plagiogramma--remains questionable in light of paraphyly for both genera using molecular and morphological data. We have expanded the available DNA for molecular work for dozens of plagiogrammacean clones and analyzed 29 morphological characters from plagiogrammarian taxa and closely related genera, to increase understanding of the evolutionary history and systematics of the family and re-evaluate the current taxonomical classification of plagiogrammacean genera. The addition of more taxa and more data confirm the results from previous molecular phylogenies: most plagiogrammacean genera are monophyletic, except for Dimeregramma and Plagiogramma. Interestingly, the morphological analysis resolves only Talaroneis and Glyphodesmis as monophyletic. Given these results, we feel there is limited support for retaining Dimeregramma and Plagiogramma as distinct genera, and formally propose amending Plagiogramma and transferring six Dimeregramma species. As the Plagiogrammaceae is also one of the first-diverging clades of pennate diatoms, we also used these molecular data to estimate the age of the family, based on multiple calibration points derived from fossil taxa within or close to the Plagiogrammaceae. The results indicated that the Plagiogrammaceae evolved more than 114 million year ago and its diversification appears to correspond to a time of climate cooling. Additionally, we described a new monotypic genus (Coccinelloidea) with one new species C. gracilis, and five new species within established genera, e.g. Plagiogramma marginalis, Plagiogramma harenae, Plagiogramma porcipellis, Neofragilaria montgomeryii and Psammogramma anacarae.},

Through over 300 ocean drilling tasks，a large amount of precious data have been obtained from the seafloor and now stored in multiple databases. Those data record the characteristics of the core samples in various aspects such as physical, chemical, lithological, micropaleontological, etc., as well as logging information. All the information has been acquired either from shipboard bservations and measurements or after-cruise experimental analysis. In addition to being stored in IODP databases, these data have been published in relevant journals of ocean drilling, and some were deposited in other professional databases. These data are difficult to combine all together because different data types among the databases and in each database, the data search routine is too simple for advanced use. To set up a comprehensive data platform to store and manage heterogeneous data from ocean drilling projects and integrate various services and functions processing the data for more broad use, will be a task for eological community in the future.},

	abstract = {This study statistically assesses the relationship between the planktic foraminiferal long-term diversity pattern ( 170 Ma to Recent) and four major paleobiological diversification models: (i) the `Red Queen' (Van Valen, 1973; Raup et al., 1973), (ii) the turnover-pulse (Vrba, 1985; Brett and Baird, 1995), (iii) the diversity-equilibrium (Sepkoski, 1978; Rosenzweig, 1995), and (iv) the `complicated logistic growth' (Alroy, 2010a). Our results suggest that the long-term standing diversity pattern and the interplay between origination and extinction rates displayed by this group do not correspond to the first three models, but can be more readily explained by the fourth scenario. Consequently, these patterns are likely controlled by a combination of planktic foraminiferal interspecific competition as well as various environmental changes such as marine global temperatures that could impacted the niches within the upper mixed layer within the oceans. Moreover, as other global long-term patterns have been interpreted as reflecting `complicated logistic growth', this study further suggests that the interplay between abiotic and biotic factors are fundamental elements influencing the evolutionary processes over the extensive history of the biota.

	abstract = {In this dissertation, I explore how the morphological diversity of coccolithophores, a major group of eukaryotic phytoplankton, manifests at different scales---from the subspecies level as the functional consequences of form, to the biogeographic patterns of disparity of families. The first part of this dissertations evaluates whether the minute morphologies of coccoliths and coccospheres can affect how a cell interacts with its fluid environment. From these biomechanical sinking experiments, I find that the size and shape of coccoliths can slow sinking velocity, and that coccospheres exhibiting asymmetric arrangements of coccoliths will reorient while sinking, demonstrating the relevance of these features. Next, I explore the spatial and environmental structure of morphological diversity in the modern ocean, by quantifying and comparing disparity across biomes and latitudes. Similar to other groups, such as marine invertebrates and flying terrestrial vertebrates, there is no clear gradient to disparity across either latitudes or biomes in this group; in fact, different regions are indistinguishable with respect to morphological disparity. This homogeneity is likely a result of the cosmopolitan range of most extant families. Finally, I examine the potential distortion of morphological disparity in fossil samples which are predominantly made up of disarticulated coccoliths, by analytically degrading extant assemblages. Coccolith morphology is poorly correlated with coccosphere morphology, but makes a reasonable proxy for whole-organism morphology. The disparity of fossil and dead assemblages is indistinguishable from that of the living assemblages, for biome and latitudinal assemblages, and for the families that could be examined. This work serves to buttress and inform future paleontological work on coccolithophorid morphological diversity, as well as to provide insights into the role of different coccolith arrangement and coccosphere shape.},

	abstract = {Ongoing climate change is predicted to trigger major shifts in the geographic distribution of marine plankton species. However, it remains unclear whether species will successfully track optimal habitats to new regions, or face extinction. Here we show that one significant zooplankton group, the radiolaria, underwent a severe decline in high latitude species richness presaged by ecologic reorganization during the late Neogene, a time of amplified polar cooling. We find that the majority (71{\%}) of affected species did not relocate to the warmer low latitudes, but went extinct. This indicates that some plankton species cannot track optimal temperatures on a global scale as assumed by ecologic models; instead, assemblages undergo restructuring and extinction once local environmental thresholds are exceeded. This pattern forewarns profound diversity loss of high latitude radiolaria in the near future, which may have cascading effects on the ocean food web and carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {In the Anthropocene, humans are altering ecosystems, causing extinctions, and reassorting species distributions. As we facilitate these changes, we are creating new collections of species. Such {\textquotedblleft}novel communities{\textquotedblright} are not specific to our epoch, and the patterns of diversity and extinction associated with past events can shed light on the implications of current community restructuring. Pandolfi et al. looked at marine plankton communities over the past \~{}66 million years and found that the emergence of novel communities leads to further novelty and extinction (see the Perspective by Dornelas and Madin). Although community change is a natural biological response to environmental change, the current rate of change could lead to impending and rapid impacts.Science, this issue p. 220; see also p. 164Environmental change is transforming ecological assemblages into new configurations, resulting in novel communities. We developed a robust methodology to detect novel communities, examine patterns of emergence, and quantify probabilities of local demographic turnover in transitions to and from novel communities. Using a global dataset of Cenozoic marine plankton communities, we found that the probability of local extinction, origination, and emigration during transitions to a novel community increased two to four times that of background community changes. Although rare, novel communities were five times more likely than chance to shift into another novel state. For marine plankton communities at a 100,000-year time grain, novel communities were sensitive to further extinctions and substantial community change.},

	abstract = {The sulfur isotope ratio (δ34S) recorded in marine barite is commonly used to estimate secular changes in the sulfur isotopic composition of seawater sulfate (δ34SSO4) throughout Earth's history. The Cenozoic record demonstrates a drastic 5‰increase in seawater δ34SSO4 during the Early Eocene. However, the gradient of this excursion is based on only a few data points. Taking advantage of a much improved biostratigraphic framework, we redefine the Eocene δ34SSO4 data with a new high-resolution barite based δ34S record between 60 and 30 Ma. Our results show that the rise of δ34SSO4 starts about 3 million years later (\~{}53 Ma) and lasts about 9 million years longer (until 38 Ma) than previously depicted. As such, the gradient of the δ34S curve is \~{}0.4‰/Myr. The radiogenic strontium isotopic ratio in barite suggests that some of the samples used for the original barite record are affected by diagenetic alteration.},

	abstract = { A tenet of conservation palaeobiology is that knowledge of past extinction patterns can help us to better predict future extinctions. Although the future is unobservable, we can test the strength of this proposition by asking how well models conditioned on past observations would have predicted subsequent extinction events at different points in the geological past. To answer this question, we analyse the well-sampled fossil record of Cenozoic planktonic microfossil taxa (Foramanifera, Radiolaria, diatoms and calcareous nanoplankton). We examine how extinction probability varies over time as a function of species age, time of observation, current geographical range, change in geographical range, climate state and change in climate state. Our models have a 70--80\% probability of correctly forecasting the rank order of extinction risk for a random out-of-sample species pair, implying that determinants of extinction risk have varied only modestly through time. We find that models which include either historical covariates or account for variation in covariate effects over time yield equivalent forecasts, but a model including both is overfit and yields biased forecasts. An important caveat is that human impacts may substantially disrupt range-risk dynamics so that the future will be less predictable than it has been in the past.

	abstract = {
            A fundamental question in ecology is how the success of a taxon changes through time and what drives this change. This question is commonly approached using trajectories averaged over a group of taxa. Using results from probability theory, we show analytically and using examples that averaged trajectories will be more symmetric as the number of averaged trajectories increases, even if none of the original trajectories they were derived from is symmetric. This effect is not only based on averaging, but also on the introduction of noise and the incorporation of a priori known origination and extinction times. This implies that averaged trajectories are not suitable for deriving information about the processes driving the success of taxa. In particular, symmetric waxing and waning, which is commonly observed and interpreted to be linked to a number of different paleobiological processes, does not allow drawing any conclusions about the nature of the underlying process.

Several of the North Pacific radiolarian events are older than in previously published equatorial Pacific calibrations, and some may be diachronous within the North Pacific. These patterns may be due to complex latitudinal patterns of clinal variation in morphotypes within lineages, or to migration events from the North Pacific towards the Equator.},

	abstract = {The iterative evolutionary radiation of planktic foraminifers is a well-documented macroevolutionary process. Here we document the accompanying size changes in entire planktic foraminiferal assemblages for the past 70 My and their relationship to paleoenvironmental changes. After the size decrease at the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/P) boundary, high latitude assemblages remained consistently small. Size evolution in low latitudes can be divided into three major phases: the first is characterized by dwarfs (65--42 Ma), the second shows moderate size fluctuations (42--14 Ma), and in the third phase, planktic foraminifers have grown to the unprecedented sizes observed today. Our analyses of size variability with paleoproxy records indicate that periods of size increase coincided with phases of global cooling (Eocene and Neogene). These periods were characterized by enhanced latitudinal and vertical temperature gradients in the oceans and high diversity (polytaxy). In the Paleocene and during the Oligocene, the observed (minor) size changes of the largely low-diversity (oligotaxic) assemblages seem to correlate with productivity changes. However, polytaxy per se was not responsible for larger test sizes.},

	abstract = {{Planktonic and benthic foraminifera are the most significant providers of information on the state of surface and deep oceans in the past. Many foraminiferal proxies rely on the knowledge of ecological preferences of individual species and the assumption that these remained similar through time. Consequently, the applicability of such proxies is limited in time by the extent of the modern fauna. By analysing extensive datasets of species occurrences, we show that the modern oceanic foraminifer fauna originated during the Neogene. This occurred during two distinct diversification pulses: one in the Middle Miocene (17--14 Ma) and the second at the Miocene/Pliocene transition (7--4 Ma). The first diversification coincides with the time of a major change in the frequency of the dominant climate cycles during the Miocene Climatic Optimum. The environmental driver of the second diversification could be related to an increased provincialism induced by the closure of the Panama Seaway, but the exact link is not clear, particularly for the plankton. Surprisingly, major changes of ocean circulation due to the growth of Antarctic ice-sheet and closure of low-latitude seaways appear to have caused mainly extinctions. Given the age of the latest diversification and extinction pulses that shaped the modern foraminiferal fauna, we conclude that calibrated proxies based on assemblage properties should not be interpreted quantitatively in sediments older than the late Pliocene.}},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the planktonic foraminifera as tracers of past oceanic environments. Paleoceanography has always been closely connected with the study of planktonic foraminifera. The prolific production and excellent preservation of foraminiferal fossils in oceanic sediments has produced probably the best fossil record on Earth, providing unparalleled archives of morphological change, faunal variations, and habitat characteristics. Planktonic foraminifera are the most common source of paleoceanographic proxies, be it through the properties of their fossil assemblages or as a substrate for extraction of geochemical signals. The steady rain of foraminiferal shells is responsible for the deposition of a large portion of deep-sea biogenic carbonate. Stable isotopic signals extracted from planktonic foraminifera soon became a standard tool for the recognition of glacial cycles and eventually facilitated the recognition of orbital pacing of the ice-ages. The chemical composition of foraminiferal calcite proved to be a fertile ground for the development of proxies. The chapter highlights the most common and most promising foraminiferal proxies and puts them in the context of modern biological knowledge.},

We determined the macroevolutionary trajectory in the median size of dinoflagellate cysts to compare with the macroevolutionary size change in other plankton groups. We found the median size of the dinoflagellate cysts generally decreases through the Cenozoic. Diatoms exhibit an extremely similar pattern in their median size over time, even though species diversity of the two groups has opposing trends, indicating that the macroevolutionary size change is an active response to selection pressure rather than a passive response to changes in diversity. The changes in the median size of dinoflagellate cysts are highly correlated with both deep ocean temperatures and the thermal gradient between the surface and deep waters, indicating the magnitude and frequency of nutrient availability may have acted as a selective factor in the macroevolution of cell size in the plankton. Our results suggest that climate, because it affects stratification in the ocean, is a universal abiotic driver that has been responsible for macroevolutionary changes in the size structure of marine planktonic communities over the past 65 million years of Earth's history.},

Both Pianka's overlap index, calculated per couple of successive samples, and cluster analysis, point to a number of significant turnover events highlighted by changes in the structure of floristic communities. The pre-warming flora, dominated by cosmopolitan species of the diatom genus Triceratium, is replaced during the warming interval by a new and more diverse assemblage, dominated by Paralia sulcata (an indicator of high productivity) and two endemic tropical species of the genus Hemiaulus. The critical warming interval is characterized by a steady increase in biogenic silica and a comparable increase in excess Ba, both reflecting an increase in productivity. In general, it appears that high productivity not only increased the flux of biogenic silica, but also sustained a higher diversity in the siliceous phytoplankton communities. The microflora preserved above the critical interval is once again of low diversity and dominated by various species of the diatom genus Hemiaulus. All assemblages in the studied material are characterized by the total absence of continental and benthic diatoms and the relative abundance of neritic forms, suggesting a transitional depositional environment between the neritic and the oceanic realms.},

We document the evolutionary history and architecture of this Extinction Group (Ext. Gp) through the Cenozoic at four lower bathyal-upper abyssal Indian Ocean sites (ODP 722, 744/738, 758, 763), seeking clues to the cause of this morphologically-targeted extinction episode late in the Cenozoic.Eighty percent of the 116 Ext Gp. species present in the Cenozoic of the Indian Ocean originated globally in the Eocene or earlier, compared with 23--37\\% of other Quaternary deep-sea foraminifera. The Ext. Gp had its peak species richness and relative and absolute abundances in the late Eocene. The rapid warming of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, that resulted in a loss of 30--50\\% of deep-sea foraminiferal species, had no impact on the Ext. Gp in the one Indian Ocean section (ODP 744/738) studied. Major Cenozoic changes in the Ext. Gp, including increased species turnover, changes in dominant species, a decline in abundance, loss in diversity, and finally extinction, mostly occurred during the middle Eocene to early Oligocene, middle to late Miocene, and late Pliocene to middle Pleistocene. These were times of stepped increase in the volume of polar ice, global oceanic cooling, surface-water eutrophication, seasonality of phytoplankton production, deep-water ventilation, and southern deep-water carbonate corrosiveness. The final decline and disappearance of the Ext. Gp began in the late Miocene at high latitudes (744/738), but not until the late Pliocene (758, 763) or MPT (722) at lower latitudes.We hypothesize that the loss of the Ext. Gp of deep-sea foraminifera may have been caused by the decline or demise of their specific food source (detrital phytoplankton or bottom-dwelling microbes) that was abundant in the Greenhouse World and was decimated by the stepwise cooling, ventilation, or eutrophication of the oceans that began in the middle and late Eocene.}},

	abstract = {{Biostratigraphy has been an integral part of hydrocarbon exploration for much of the last century. The basic concepts and methods of using fossils to characterize coeval strata remain unchanged from the pioneer studies of the late 18th century. This paper describes major developments in biostratigraphic techniques that have occurred during the last twenty years.Advances in deep-water drilling and exploitation technology have promoted a shift from deltaic and shelf reservoirs to slope and basin-floor-fan reservoir targets. This has resulted in a greater emphasis on open marine, planktonic fossils, such as nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera, and lesser emphasis on terrestrial and shallow-water fossils such as benthic foraminifera, pollen, and spores. The development of deviated and horizontal production wells has stimulated the need to monitor the path of wells in real time at the wellsite. The resulting ``biosteering'' is the quantitative bed-by-bed study of a vertical pilot well, and the subsequent monitoring of the fossil content of the horizontal well, which enables the drill path to stay in the target strata.The Ocean Drilling Program and its predecessor the Deep Sea Drilling Project led to the construction of more refined geologic time scales that integrate biostratigraphy with magnetostratigraphy, isotope stratigraphy, and astronomical cycles. These time scales allow the allocation of numeric ages to increasing amounts of biostratigraphic datums, which aids in the automation of correlation using computers. The concepts and methods of sequence stratigraphy refined in the last twenty years placed biostratigraphy at the heart of geological models, closely integrating it with well-log and seismic stratigraphy. The concepts of sequence stratigraphy stimulated further biostratigraphic research and changed the way biostratigraphic data are used in correlations.Computational power has made it possible to rapidly record, manipulate, and display biostratigraphic data. This has led to the development of programs that automate the process of correlation, paleobathymetric interpretation, construction of expert systems for the identification of fossils, and compilation of databases of text and digital images. These advances have led to more information being extracted from the raw biostratigraphic data.Application of Modern Stratigraphic Techniques: Theory and Case HistoriesSEPM Special Publication No. 94, Copyright {\copyright} 2010SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology), ISBN 978-1-56576-199-5, p. 57--80.}},

	abstract = {The amount and quality of paleontological data is rapidly increasing thanks to the new developments in geological dating, 3D visualization and morphometrics, chemical and histological analysis, and database storage. However, despite the fact that data from fossils, their assemblages, temporal successions, spatial gradients and environments are of an evolutionary-ecological nature, their contribution to current mainstream evolutionary-ecological theory and methodology is low. The use of fossils is not seldom restricted to calibration (e.g., in phylogenetics), or source for historical speculation after having analyzed modern data first (e.g., in macroecology). Yet, the scale of resolution of many paleontological time series (103--105 years) is highly apt for studying the dynamics of species, the average lifetime of which is in the order of 106--107 years. In order to fully profit from the wealth of data from the rock archive, a large-scale ``stratophenomics''approach is needed. The resulting data archives will not only further contribute to an increase in the knowledge of past species, communities and environments, but will also generate more and innovative theory on the mechanisms underlying species and higher taxon dynamics. Examples of new and promising approaches towards generating paleontological data will be presented under the headings of the three major stratophenomics dimensions: time, morphology and environment. Highlighted fields include astrochronology, sclerochronology and 3D morphometrics.},

	abstract = {Long-term evolution is thought to take opportunities that arise as a consequence of mass extinction (as argued, for example, by Gould, 2002) and the following biotic recovery, but there is absolutely no evidence for this being the case. However, our study shows that eutrophication by oceanic mixing also played a part in the enhancement of several evolutionary events amongst marine organisms, and these results could indicate that the rates of oceanic biodiversification may be slowed if upwelling becomes weakened by future global warming. This paper defines three distinct evolutionary events of resting spores of the marine diatom genus Chaetoceros, to reconstruct past upwelling through the analysis of several DSDP, ODP and land-based successions from the North, South and equatorial Pacific as well as the Atlantic Ocean during the past 40million years. The Atlantic Chaetoceros Explosion (ACE) event occurred across the E/O boundary in the North Atlantic, and is characterized by resting spore diversification that occurred as a consequence of the onset of upwelling following changes in thermohaline circulation through global cooling in the early Oligocene. Pacific Chaetoceros Explosion events-1 and -2 (PACE-1 and PACE-2) are characterized by relatively higher occurrences of iron input following the Himalayan uplift and aridification at 8.5Ma and ca. 2.5Ma in the North Pacific region. These events not only enhanced the diversification and increased abundance of primary producers, including that of Chaetoceros, other diatoms and seaweeds, but also stimulated the evolution of zooplankton and larger predators, such as copepods and marine mammals, which ate these phytoplankton and plants. Current thinking suggests new evolutionary niches open up after a mass extinction, but our study finds that eutrophication can also stimulate evolutionary diversification. Moreover, in the opposite fashion, our results show that as thermohaline circulation abates, global warming progresses and the ocean surface becomes warmer, many marine organisms will be affected by the environmental degradation.},

	abstract = {Size is one of the most important characteristics of any organism and can readily be used in quantitative analyses of patterns in physiology, ecology, and evolution. One of the best archives for the history of organism evolution are deep-sea sediments, because (1) microfossils are one of their major constituents, (2) they can be accurately dated, and (3) they are available from almost all areas of the world. We present new data on size variations of entire oval to circular coccolith assemblages during the last 65million years from a number of globally distributed deep-sea cores. We document the generally decreasing size patterns of these assemblages from the early Cenozoic to the Holocene and show that higher size variability and thus largest sizes can be observed in high latitudes. However, the documented size trends are not directly related to available proxies for paleoenvironmental conditions. Taxonomic investigations of the measured assemblages indicate that the evolution, abundance, and extinction of large-sized species in different lineages, such as Calcidiscus, Coccolithus, Chiasmolithus, Cruciplacolithus, Helicosphaera, and Reticulofenestra, and the newly developed small-coccolith producing taxa in the Neogene, such as Emiliania, Gephyrocapsa, Reticulofenestra haqii, R. minutula and Umbilicosphaeraceae, are responsible for the observed assemblage size variations during the last 65million years.},

	abstract = {Theories of taxonomic diversification dispute whether global diversity has an upper limit set by the strength of biological interactions or grows in unlimited fashion until catastrophic events reset the system. We analyzed a global compendium of fossil planktic foraminifera from the early Cretaceous to the present after correcting for temporal differences in sampling effort. Our results show that their morphological diversity has increased exponentially through time in two different phases. The first phase collapsed at the Cretaceous--Paleogene boundary transition. The second phase developed through the Cenozoic era and declined during the Pliocene--Pleistocene interval, a period of time that was dominated by enhanced climatic and oceanographic instability. In none of these phases diversity reached an equilibrium level. Cenozoic faunas evolved faster than those inhabiting Cretaceous oceans, perhaps as a result of a higher environmental variability. Our results indicate that planktic foraminifera conform to an exponential diversification model. However, because catastrophic events have repeatedly reset the level of biological diversity and have kept it below the maximum, we cannot confirm whether the level of diversity is potentially unlimited.},

@article{Weiner:2015aa,
	abstract = {Molecular genetic investigations of the highly abundant extant planktonic foraminifera plexus Globigerinella siphonifera/Globigerinella calida have recently shown this group to be the genetically most diverse one within planktonic foraminifera, separating it into 12 distinct genetic types belonging to three main genetic lineages. Independently, several morphological or physiological variants have been described within the group, but the correlation between the high genetic diversity and the phenotypic variability remains unclear. In this study, we combine genetic data with morphometric analyses of shell shape and porosity of genotyped individuals of the different genetic lineages. Our morphometric measurements suggest a differentiation of three morphotypes within the plexus, two of which possess the elongated chambers described as a typical trait of G. calida. These two morphotypes with elongated chambers are associated with two distinct genetic lineages. The G. calida morphology therefore appears to have evolved twice in parallel. Unexpectedly, we show that the two morphotypes with elongated chambers can be separated from each other by characters seen in the lateral view of their shells. This implies that the taxonomy of the extant members of the genus Globigerinella should be revised. A comparison with the original descriptions and type specimens of members of the genus shows that two genetic types of one major lineage correspond to G. calida. The second group with elongated chambers is associated with a recently diverged genetic type and we propose to reinstate the name Globigerinella radians for this distinct form. The remaining nine of the 12 genetic types correspond to the G. siphonifera morphology, and in the absence of evidence for morphological differentiation, they form a paraphyletic morpho-taxon. Our results highlight the prevalence of parallelism in the evolution of shell morphology in planktonic foraminifera even at the lowest level of relatedness represented by genetic types.},

Acquiring data on the occurrences of many types of difficult to identify objects are often still made by human observation, for example, in biodiversity and paleontologic research. Existing computer counting programs used to record such data have various limitations, including inflexibility and cost. We describe a new open-source program for this purpose---Raritas. Raritas is written in Python and can be run as a standalone app for recent versions of either MacOS or Windows, or from the command line as easily customized source code. The program explicitly supports a rare category count mode which makes it easier to collect quantitative data on rare categories, for example, rare species which are important in biodiversity surveys. Lastly, we describe the file format used by Raritas and propose it as a standard for storing geologic biodiversity data. `Stratigraphic occurrence data' file format combines extensive sample metadata and a flexible structure for recording occurrence data of species or other categories in a series of samples.

	abstract = {The illustrations of the late nineteenth-/twentieth-century scientist/artist Ernst Haeckel, as depicted in his book Art Forms in Nature (originally in German as Kunstformen der Natur, 1898--1904), have been at the intersection of art, biology, and mathematics for over a century. Haeckel's images of radiolaria (microscopic protozoans described as amoeba in glass houses) have influenced various artists for over a century (glass artists Leopold and Rudolph Blaschka; sculptor Henry Moore; architects Rene Binet, Zaha Hadid, Antoni Gaudi, Chris Bosse and Frank Gehry; and designers--filmmakers Charles and Ray Eames). We focus on this history and extend the artistic, biological, and mathematical contributions of this interdisciplinary legacy by going beyond the 3D visual, topological, and geometric analyses of radiolaria to include the nanoscale with graph theory, spatial statistics, and computational geometry. We analyze multiple visualizations of radiolaria generated through Haeckel's images, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, micro- and nanotomography, and three-dimensional computer rendering.Mathematical analyses are conducted using the image analysis package ``Ka-me: A Voronoi Image Analyzer.'' Further analyses utilize three-dimensional printing, laser etched crystalline glass art, and sculpture. Open sharing of three-dimensional nanotomography of radiolaria and other protozoa through MorphoSource enables new possibilities for artists, architects, paleontologists, structural morphologists, taxonomists, museum curators, and mathematical biologists. Distinctively, newer models of radiolaria fit into a larger context of productive interdisciplinary collaboration that continues Haeckel's legacy that lay a foundation for new work in biomimetic design and additive manufacturing where artistic and scientific models mutually and robustly generate wonder, beauty, utility, curiosity, insight, environmentalism, theory, and questions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Unbiased time series of diversity dynamics are vital for quantifying the grand history of life. Applications include identifying ancient mass extinctions and inferring both biotic and abiotic controls on diversification rates. We introduce divDyn, a new r package that facilitates the calculation of taxonomic richness, extinction and origination rates from time-binned fossil data. State-of-the-art counting protocols, and sampling standardization functions permit the reconstruction of biologically meaningful time series. Additional functions permit the partitioning of turnover rates by environmental affinity. Using divDyn, we display Phanerozoic-scale diversity dynamics of marine invertebrates. With the help of the core function and standard subsampling options, we revisit the hypothesis of declining taxonomic rates over time, mass extinctions and equilibrial diversity dynamics and assess their methodological dependency. Our results suggest that rates declined only over the early Phanerozoic, only three mass extinctions stand out clearly, and evidence of equilibrial dynamics is dependent on the used methods. The modular and fast implementation of published methods ensures traceability, reproducibility and comparability of future studies.},

@article{Lewitus162248,
	abstract = {Understanding the relative influence of various abiotic and biotic variables on diversification dynamics is a major goal of macroevolutionary studies. Recently, phylogenetic approaches have been developed that make it possible to estimate the role of various environmental variables on diversification using time-calibrated species trees, paleoenvironmental data, and maximum-likelihood techniques. These approaches have been effectively employed to estimate how speciation and extinction rates vary with key abiotic variables, such as temperature and sea level, and we can anticipate that they will be increasingly used in the future. Here we compile a series of biotic and abiotic paleodatasets that can be used as explanatory variables in these models and use simulations to assess the statistical properties of the approach when applied to these paleodatasets. We demonstrate that environment-dependent models perform well in recovering environment-dependent speciation and extinction parameters, as well as in correctly identifying the simulated environmental model when speciation is environment-dependent. We explore how the strength of the environment-dependency, tree size, missing taxa, and characteristics of the paleoenvironmental curves influence the performance of the models. Finally, using these models, we infer environment-dependent diversification in three empirical phylogenies: temperature-dependence in Cetacea, δ13C-dependence in Ruminantia, and CO2-dependence in Portulacaceae. We illustrate how to evaluate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic variables in these three clades and interpret these results in light of macroevolutionary hypotheses for mammals and plants. Given the important role paleoenvironments are presumed to have played in species evolution, our statistical assessment of how environment-dependent models behave is crucial for their utility in macroevolutionary analysis.},

	abstract = {Common species shape the world around us, and changes in their commonness signify large-scale shifts in ecosystem structure and function. However, our understanding of long-term ecosystem response to environmental forcing in the deep past is centred on species richness, neglecting the disproportional impact of common species. Here, we use common and widespread species of planktonic foraminifera in deep-sea sediments to track changes in observed global occupancy (proportion of sampled sites at which a species is present and observed) through the turbulent climatic history of the last 65 Myr. Our approach is sensitive to relative changes in global abundance of the species set and robust to factors that bias richness estimators. Using three independent methods for detecting causality, we show that the observed global occupancy of planktonic foraminifera has been dynamically coupled to past oceanographic changes captured in deep-ocean temperature reconstructions. The causal inference does not imply a direct mechanism, but is consistent with an indirect, time-delayed causal linkage. Given the strong quantitative evidence that a dynamical coupling exists, we hypothesize that mixotrophy (symbiont hosting) may be an ecological factor linking the global abundance of planktonic foraminifera to long-term climate changes via the relative extent of oligotrophic oceans.},

	abstract = {Correlations between past biotic diversity and climate can inform
humanity's response to predictions of future global climate change,
e.g., extinction risk with global warming. Paleodiversity studies, however,
frequently use genera as a proxy for species diversity, a practice
that has often been questioned. Tests using actual data of the impact
of using species-level versus genus-level taxonomy in paleodiversity-paleoenvironmental
studies are also lacking. We conduct such a test,
based on a recent study that showed a strong correlation of Cenozoic
marine planktonic diatom species diversity to geochemical climate
proxies. Using an updated version of the data set, we still find a strong
correlation of Cenozoic diatom species diversity to environment. Using
identical data but instead genera results in the loss of all significant
correlations of diversity to environmental change. This occurs due to
the earlier rise and later stability in genus versus species diversity data,
a pattern known to be common between taxonomic ranks in the fossil
record, and in general models of diversification. We conclude that
studies of paleodiversity, particularly those addressing biotic responses
to future environmental change, need to demonstrate the adequacy
of genera as a proxy for species diversity, or use species-level data.},
