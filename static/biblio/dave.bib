@article{Fenton2021,
	abstract = {Planktonic foraminifera are a major constituent of ocean floor sediments, and thus have one of the most complete fossil records of any organism. Expeditions to sample these sediments have produced large amounts of spatiotemporal occurrence records throughout the Cenozoic, but no single source exists to house these data. We have therefore created a comprehensive dataset that integrates numerous sources for spatiotemporal records of planktonic foraminifera. This new dataset, Triton, contains >500,000 records and is four times larger than the previous largest database, Neptune. To ensure comparability among data sources, we have cleaned all records using a unified set of taxonomic concepts and have converted age data to the GTS 2020 timescale. Where ages were not absolute (e.g. based on biostratigraphic or magnetostratigraphic zones), we have used generalised additive models to produce continuous estimates. This dataset is an excellent resource for macroecological and macroevolutionary studies, particularly for investigating how species responded to past climatic changes.},

@article{Trubovitz:2020aa,
	abstract = {Ongoing climate change is predicted to trigger major shifts in the geographic distribution of marine plankton species. However, it remains unclear whether species will successfully track optimal habitats to new regions, or face extinction. Here we show that one significant zooplankton group, the radiolaria, underwent a severe decline in high latitude species richness presaged by ecologic reorganization during the late Neogene, a time of amplified polar cooling. We find that the majority (71{\%}) of affected species did not relocate to the warmer low latitudes, but went extinct. This indicates that some plankton species cannot track optimal temperatures on a global scale as assumed by ecologic models; instead, assemblages undergo restructuring and extinction once local environmental thresholds are exceeded. This pattern forewarns profound diversity loss of high latitude radiolaria in the near future, which may have cascading effects on the ocean food web and carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Body size is a central feature of any organism, reflecting its physiology, ecology and evolutionary history. Marine microplankton are major contributors to the particulate inorganic carbonate (foraminifers and coccolithophorids) and opal flux (radiolaria and diatoms) in the ocean and, hence, size changes in these organisms can influence global biogeochemical cycles. This paper is discussing abiotic influences on micro- and macroecological size changes among major marine plankton groups, linking these to evolutionary size changes during the Neogene. We review the patterns and outline the causes of size changes geographically and through time in coccolithophorids, foraminifers and radiolarians. The main feature of the Neogene size record is a dramatic size increase in foraminifers, a similarly dramatic reduction in the size range of coccolithophorids and highly variable size patterns in radiolarians. We argue that the observed pattern is too complex to be explained by a simple common forcing and propose that speculations on the response of oceanic biomineralisation to global warming have to consider the scales at which marine plankton evolve.},

	abstract = {Summary Charles Darwin, like others before him, collected aeolian dust over the Atlantic Ocean and sent it to Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in Berlin. Ehrenberg's collection is now housed in the Museum of Natural History and contains specimens that were gathered at the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Geochemical analyses of this resource indicated that dust collected over the Atlantic in 1838 originated from the Western Sahara, while molecular-microbiological methods demonstrated the presence of many viable microbes. Older samples sent to Ehrenberg from Barbados almost two centuries ago also contained numbers of cultivable bacteria and fungi. Many diverse ascomycetes, and eubacteria were found. Scanning electron microscopy and cultivation suggested that Bacillus megaterium, a common soil bacterium, was attached to historic sand grains, and it was inoculated onto dry sand along with a non-spore-forming control, the Gram-negative soil bacterium Rhizobium sp. NGR234. On sand B. megaterium quickly developed spores, which survived for extended periods and even though the numbers of NGR234 steadily declined, they were still considerable after months of incubation. Thus, microbes that adhere to Saharan dust can live for centuries and easily survive transport across the Atlantic.},

	abstract = {The changing composition of radiolarian faunas from late Neogene deep-sea sediments has been used in recent years as a proxy for changes in marine paleoproductivity. We examine radiolarian faunas, organic carbon content (TOC), opal and coarse-fraction components over the last 270,000 years in sediments from ODP Hole 1084A, drilled in a high productivity upwelling region within the Benguela Upwelling System off the west coast of Africa. Age control is provided by stable oxygen isotope measurements of benthic foraminifera. Prior research has established that late Pleistocene glacial intervals in this upwelling system generally had higher productivity than interglacials. The radiolarian WADE (water-depth ecology) paleoproductivity index correlates well with TOC and opal in these samples, and all three parameters change in synchrony with the benthic isotope curve over all but the MIS 5e--6 time interval. WADE inferred productivity is significantly higher in glacials than interglacials. We conclude that the WADE index is a useful proxy for paleoproductivity at this location, as are also opal and organic carbon accumulation rates. Carbonate and carbonate based indices such as the accumulation rate of benthic foraminifera (BFAR) by contrast do not correlate well either to productivity indices or to the glacial--interglacial cycle, and are interpreted to primarily reflect carbonate dissolution.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the first register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered.
Results
There are ∼226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (∼20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are ∼170,000 synonyms, that 58,000--72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000--741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7--1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 $\pm$ 0.2 million marine species. On average 37% (median 31%) of species in over 100 recent field studies around the world might be new to science.
Conclusions
Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century.},

@article{Wiese20102016,
	abstract = {Correlations between past biotic diversity and climate can inform
humanity's response to predictions of future global climate change,
e.g., extinction risk with global warming. Paleodiversity studies, however,
frequently use genera as a proxy for species diversity, a practice
that has often been questioned. Tests using actual data of the impact
of using species-level versus genus-level taxonomy in paleodiversity-paleoenvironmental
studies are also lacking. We conduct such a test,
based on a recent study that showed a strong correlation of Cenozoic
marine planktonic diatom species diversity to geochemical climate
proxies. Using an updated version of the data set, we still find a strong
correlation of Cenozoic diatom species diversity to environment. Using
identical data but instead genera results in the loss of all significant
correlations of diversity to environmental change. This occurs due to
the earlier rise and later stability in genus versus species diversity data,
a pattern known to be common between taxonomic ranks in the fossil
record, and in general models of diversification. We conclude that
studies of paleodiversity, particularly those addressing biotic responses
to future environmental change, need to demonstrate the adequacy
of genera as a proxy for species diversity, or use species-level data.},

	abstract = {
Acquiring data on the occurrences of many types of difficult to identify objects are often still made by human observation, for example, in biodiversity and paleontologic research. Existing computer counting programs used to record such data have various limitations, including inflexibility and cost. We describe a new open-source program for this purpose---Raritas. Raritas is written in Python and can be run as a standalone app for recent versions of either MacOS or Windows, or from the command line as easily customized source code. The program explicitly supports a rare category count mode which makes it easier to collect quantitative data on rare categories, for example, rare species which are important in biodiversity surveys. Lastly, we describe the file format used by Raritas and propose it as a standard for storing geologic biodiversity data. `Stratigraphic occurrence data' file format combines extensive sample metadata and a flexible structure for recording occurrence data of species or other categories in a series of samples.
